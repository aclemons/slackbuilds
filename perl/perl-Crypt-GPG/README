Crypt::GPG - An Object Oriented Interface to GnuPG.

DESCRIPTION
  The Crypt::GPG module provides access to the functionality of the GnuPG
  (www.gnupg.org) encryption tool through an object oriented interface.  It
  provides methods for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification,
  key generation, key certification, export and import. Key-server access is on
  the todo list.

This requires perl-TimeDate available on slackbuilds.org and perl-IPC-Run
available from my slackbuilds.
