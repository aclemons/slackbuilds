rustup - The Rust toolchain installer

To use the versions of rust installed through rustup, you'll need to add links
to the rustup binary on your path before the system rust.

You are free to choose where, but here is an example:

mkdir -p $HOME/.rustup/shims
for lnk in cargo rls rustc rustdoc rust-gdb rust-lldb ; do
  (
    ln -s /usr/bin/rustup $lnk
  )
done

Then add the directory to your path (.bashrc for example):
export PATH="$HOME/.rustup/shims:$PATH"
