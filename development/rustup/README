rustup - The Rust toolchain installer

This package conflicts with rust/cargo. Because rustup itself is written in
rust, you need rust/cargo built and installed to build rustup. They must then
be removed and you can then install rustup. Future versions of rustup can then
be built with a version of cargo installed through rustup itself. Only the
initial bootstrap will need a system wide install of rust / cargo.

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, if you already have cargo-vendor installed, you can
create a "vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded
into a single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script rustup-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The slackbuild
will automatically use this tarball if found in the current directory.
