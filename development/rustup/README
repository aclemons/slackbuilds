rustup - The Rust toolchain installer

This package conflicts with rust/cargo. Because rustup itself is written in
rust, you need rust/cargo built and installed to build rustup. They must then
be removed and you can then install rustup. Future versions of rustup can then
be built with a version of cargo installed through rustup itself. Only the
initial bootstrap will need a system wide install of rust / cargo.

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, if you already have cargo-vendor installed, you can
create a "vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded
into a single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script rustup-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The slackbuild
will automatically use this tarball if found in the current directory.

To always use rustup instead of the system rust, do this once for each user
wanting to use rustup:

mkdir $HOME/.rustup/shims
for lnk in cargo rls rustc rustdoc rust-gdb rust-lldb ; do #   (
    ln -s /usr/bin/rustup "$lnk"
  )
done

Then add the directory to your path (.bashrc for example):
export PATH="$HOME/.rustup/shims:${PATH}"
