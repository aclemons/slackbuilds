P4V, the Perforce Visual Client, provides quick and easy access to versioned
files through a graphical interface that is consistent across multiple
operating systems. 

P4V represents the files in a project in the same 
file/folder hierarchy employed by the native operating system. File state 
information indicates which file versions are currently on the user's 
workstation and on the Perforce Server.
