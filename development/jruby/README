JRuby is a high performance, stable, fully threaded Java implementation
of the Ruby programming language.

apache-maven is only need to build this package, not at runtime.

To avoid collisions with ruby packaged with slackware, gem, rdoc, ri and
testrb are linked into /usr/lib with a jruby- prefix.
