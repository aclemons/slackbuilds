This package will install the basic instant client package (all files required
to run OCI, OCCI, and JDBC-OCI applications)

You will need an Oracle account to be able to download the source rpms. This
slackbuild just repackages the rpms provided by Oracle and automatically sets
up the ORACLE_HOME environment variable and ld.so.conf with the oracle
libraries.
