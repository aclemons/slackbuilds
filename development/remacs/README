remacs - Rust loves Emacs

A community-driven port of Emacs to Rust.

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, if you have cargo-vendor installed, you can create a
"vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded into a
single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script remacs-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The slackbuild
will automatically use this tarball if found in the current directory.
