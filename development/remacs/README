remacs - Rust loves Emacs

A community-driven port of Emacs to Rust.

remacs unfortunately requires a nightly version of rust at the moment. You
need to install rustup and then:

    rustup install nightly-2017-11-12

Make sure the rustup wrapper for cargo/rust is on your path before the system
rust for the build to succeed.
