This package will install the basic instant client 11.2 SDK (SDK: Additional
header files and an example makefile for developing Oracle applications with
Instant Client)

You will need an Oracle account to be able to download the source rpms. This
slackbuild just repackages the rpms provided by Oracle.

I use this slackbuild for compiling packages which need the oracle SDK, like
TOra.
