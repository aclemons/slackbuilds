tora (Database front end)

TOra is a Toolkit for Oracle which aims to help the DBA or
developer of database application. Features PL/SQL debugger,
SQL worksheet with syntax highlighting, DB browser and a
comprehensive set of DBA tools. TOra also includes support for
MySQL and Postgresql.

If you have installed the Oracle bindings you can build TOra with oracle
support as follows:

WITH_ORACLE=yes ./tora.SlackBuild

This requires the oracle header files. If you have a different version than the
one created by my slackbuild, adjust the path in the slackbuild.

TOra will be built with Postgres support if you have it installed. You can get
the slackbuild from slackbuilds.org. To actually use it, you will also need
libqsqlpsql also available on slackbuilds.org.
