resty - Resty is a tiny script wrapper for curl.

Since resty is just a script to be sourced by bash shells, it is added to
/etc/profile.d

Two utilities are provided, pp and pypp, which can be used to pretty print json
output. pypp doesn't need any dependencies. pp needs perl-JSON available on
slackbuilds.org.

Optional dependencies: perl-JSON
