eclim - The power of Eclipse in your favorite editor.

Eclim provides the ability to access Eclipse code editing features via the
command line or a local network connection, allowing those features to be
integrated with your favorite editor.

This package builds against eclipse-java, but can also be built against
eclipse-jee or eclipse-cpp instead. In that case, pass the eclipse home
directory to the script:

ECLIPSE_HOME=/opt/eclipse-jee ./eclim.SlackBuild

or

ECLIPSE_HOME=/opt/eclipse-cpp ./eclim.SlackBuild

apache-ant and Sphinx are only needed at build-time, not runtime.
