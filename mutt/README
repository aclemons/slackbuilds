Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt is highly
configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with advanced features
like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading, regular expression searches
and a powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of messages.

This is a slightly modified version of the vanilla slackbuild for mutt which
adds the current ubuntu patches (which are based on debian's) to create a
patched mutt. Also I link against gnutls and enable header caching with
tokyocabinet.
