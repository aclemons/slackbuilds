prosody-mod-throttle-presence (XEP-0352: Client State Indication Imp)

For most people 'presence' (status changes) of contacts make up most
of the traffic received by their client. However much of the time it
is not essential to have highly accurate presence information.

This module automatically cuts down on presence traffic when clients
indicate they are inactive (using the CSI protocol).
