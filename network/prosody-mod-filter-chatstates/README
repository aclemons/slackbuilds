prosody-mod-filter-chatstates (XEP-0352: Client State Indication Imp)

Some mobile XMPP client developers consider Chat State Notifications
to be a waste of power and bandwidth, especially when the user is
not actively looking at their device. This module will filter them
out while the session is considered inactive.
