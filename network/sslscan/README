SSLScan queries SSL services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the
ciphers that are supported.  SSLScan is designed to be easy, lean and
fast. The output includes prefered ciphers of the SSL service, the
certificate, and is in Text and XML formats.

By default, this slackbuild will build OpenSSL 1.0.2 and statically
link sslscan against it. This gives the widest compatibility for
scanning. You can build against the system openssl with:

STATIC=no

This is a slackbuild for the forked version from rbsec on github.
