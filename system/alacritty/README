alacritty - A cross-platform, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, if you already have cargo-vendor installed, you can
create a "vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded
into a single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script alacritty-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The slackbuild
will automatically use this tarball if found in the current directory.
