E-MailRelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message transfer agent
(MTA). When running as a proxy all e-mail messages can be passed through a
user-defined program, such as a spam filter, which can drop, re-address or edit
messages as they pass through. When running as a store-and-forward MTA incoming
messages are stored in a local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next
SMTP server on request.

The slackbuild can patch the source to support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 It can
additionally also disable SSLv2 and SSLv3 support. By default, both of these
options are enabled. You can change the behaviour with these flags:

DISABLE_LEGACY_SSL=no
ENABLE_TLS_11_12=no
