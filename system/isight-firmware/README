This slackbuild creates a package for the isight-firmware.

The isight-firmware tools are used to extract the firmware for the camera and
then create a slackware package from it. You will need the firmware file from
your OS X partition or you can extract is from the installation DVD. You can
mount the DVD like this:

# /sbin/losetup /dev/loop0 /dev/sr0
# partx -av /dev/loop0 # fine the correct partition
# file -s /dev/loop0*
# mount -t hfsplus -o ro /dev/loop0p3 /media/dvd
# find /media/dvd -name AppleUSBVideoSupport

You can find it on your OS X partition here:
/System/Library/Extensions/IOUSBFamily.kext/Contents/PlugIns/AppleUSBVideoSupport.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleUSBVideoSupport

No md5sum or version is specified since it will depend on your OS X version.

Requires: isight-firmware-tools
