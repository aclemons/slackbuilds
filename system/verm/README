Verm is a WORM (write-once, read-many) file store to make it easy to reliably
store and replicate files.

Currently there is no rc.* script in this package.

You can start the service in rc.local with something like:

verm -listen localhost >> /var/log/verm.log 2>> /var/log/verm.err

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not needed for runtime.
