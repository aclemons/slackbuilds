qgit (QGit is a git GUI viewer built on Qt/C++.)

QGit is a git GUI viewer built on Qt/C++.  With qgit you will be able to browse
revisions history, view patch content and changed files, graphically following
different development branches. 

Unfortunately I need to patch the sources to get them to compile correctly. The
first patches the src/src.pro to remove the hardcoded ~/bin installation
directory. The other patches qgit to work with the newest git version.
repo-config has been deprecated. This patch comes from the Fedora build config
for qgit.
