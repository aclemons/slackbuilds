Java Readline is a JNI wrapper for the GNU readline or the editline command
line libraries.

The native library incorrectly converts characters if your locale is UTF-8. You
can build with UTF8FIX=yes to apply a patch to fix this. It is not a proper fix
though since it then breaks non-utf8 locales.  If you know how to properly fix
it, please report it with a patch upstream
