This SlackBuild just repackages the jupiter rpm.

This package requires mono and gtk-sharp, available on slackbuilds.org.

This script requires a group 'jupiter' to work. Add it before running the script.

groupadd jupiter

Any users which should be able to user jupiter should be added to this group.

usermod -G jupiter -a <user>
