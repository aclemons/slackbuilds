This is a SlackBuild that will repackage SAP JVM into a package that
can be easily installed, upgraded, or removed using Slackware's native
package management tools.

To use it, you'll need SAP's JVM package for Linux.  Get the
appropriate version for your architecture, either 32-bit i586 or 64-bit
x64.  Be sure to get the version that is packaged as a .tar.gz!

Then, run the script like this:

./java.SlackBuild /tmp/sapjvm7-7.1.1326.linux.x86_64.tar.gz

A Slackware txz package will be created in /tmp.  Install or upgrade it
with a command like this one (adjust for arch, and version):

upgradepkg --install-new sapjvm-7.1.1326-x86_64-1.txz
