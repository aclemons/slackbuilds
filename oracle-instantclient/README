This package will install the basic instant client package (all files required
to run OCI, OCCI, and JDBC-OCI applications), SQL*Plus (additional libraries
and executable for running SQL*Plus with Instant Client), and the SDK (SDK:
Additional header files and an example makefile for developing Oracle
applications with Instant Client)

You will need an Oracle account to be able to download the source rpms. This
slackbuild just repackages the rpms provided by Oracle and automatically sets
up the ORACLE_HOME environment variable and ld.so.conf with the oracle
libraries.

If you would rather set up the ld library configs yourself:
SKIP_LDCONFIG="yes" ./oracle-instantclient.SlackBuild

I use this slackbuild for SQL*Plus and to be able to compile packages which
need the oracle SDK, like TOra.
