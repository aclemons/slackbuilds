The Agent Controller contains a server that has the capability to launch and
manage local or remote applications from a local TPTP workbench.

http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/4.7.0/documents/installguide/AgentController.html

A Java profiling engine is also included in the Agent Controller. The Java
profiling engine uses the JVMPI (on Java 1.4.x and lower) and JVMTI (or Java
1.5 and higher) to profile local or remote Java applications from a local TPTP
workbench. Using the corresponding TPTP build, you can launch and profile local
or remote Java applications and import local or remote Apache error and access
logs. 

If you would rather set up the ld library configs yourself:
SKIP_LDCONFIG="yes" ./tptp-agent-controller.SlackBuild

After installation you will need to run SetConfig.sh script from a command
shell in the <install-dir>/bin directory to generate the configuration file for
the Agent Controller.

To have agent controller started automatically at boot and be shut down properly,
make sure rc.tptp-agent-controller is executable and add the following lines to
the following files:

/etc/rc.d/rc.local
==================
# start agent contoller
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tptp-agent-controller ]; then
   /etc/rc.d/rc.tptp-agent-controller start
fi

/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
===========================
# stop agent controller
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tptp-agent-controller ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.tptp-agent-controller stop
fi
