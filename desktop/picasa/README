Google's Picasa Image Suite

Picasa is software that helps you instantly find, edit and share all the
pictures on your PC. Every time you open Picasa, it automatically locates
all your pictures (even ones you forgot you had) and sorts them into visual
albums organized by date with folder names you will recognize. Picasa also
makes advanced editing simple by putting one click fixes and powerful effects
at your fingertips.

NOTE: As best I can tell, the browser plugin and screensaver plugin do not
work correctly, if at all; patches are welcome.

Also note that while this should *build* a 64bit package, it requires 32bit
compatibility libraries to actually be usable.  We don't support those those
here, so caveat lector.
